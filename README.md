## Project Title: 
Stock Market

## Project Description
We are building a stock market app that will extract data from an API. It will display graphs and can provide the user with certain stock calculations  such as PE ratios, market capitalizations and more. The user will be able to search, view, and bookmark certain stocks. Additionally, the app will contain a drop-down menu where the user can view their bookmarked stocks. Furthermore, the user will be able to set the app to send notifications for when a stock is up or down a certain percentage.

## Functional Requirements

### User interface requirements:

- Users can see the PE ratio, market capitalization, and dividend yield of individual stocks (see information about the stock).
- Users can bookmark their favourite stocks up to 3 and access them easily.
~~- The application will have a “Dropdown” menu on the left side of the screen.~~
~~- Users will be able to search stocks by their stock ticker symbols.~~
- The Android app will display the current value of the searched stock by default.
- The app will display the change in stock value over different set time-frames such as  7 days, 1 month, 6 months, and up to 1 year.
- The app will be able to extract some information from the API and display a description of the company.
- The users can select two stocks and compare the two.
- Users can see the logo of each company above their stock graphs.
- The app will be able to push notifications to the user about a stock price going up or down a certain amount of their favourite stocks.
- Stock graphs will display the colour red when they have been declining and the colour green when they have been growing in the set time-frame.


### Programing Requirements
- Our app will borrow data from the Google Finance API.
~~- The app will run on Android and will be developed in Java.~~
~~- The application will only have a limited selection of stocks displaying stocks from the most popular stock indexes.~~
- The app can be properly displayed in landscape and portrait.
